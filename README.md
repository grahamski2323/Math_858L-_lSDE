# Math_858L-_lSDE
lSDE method from Weinberger et al. (2005) - Math 858L final project

Must download the CVX package at: http://cvxr.com/cvx/

Run cvx_setup to initialize the cvx package.

Then, use lSDE_script in order toperform the algorithm for Swiss roll data. The code is set up to run n=200, 500, and 1000 runs presented in our Math 858L final presentation.

Can run with both full constraints and the reduced lSDE hueristic method.
